Build your own awesome digital store themes
-------------------------------------------------------

Easy Digital Downloads makes it exceptionally easy to setup a digital store, and this theme
is designed to make it really easy to create your own themes, built just for EDD.

Child theme ready
-------------------------------------------------------

The EDD Starter theme is ready for child themes, and I highly recommend you set yours up as a child theme.

To setup a child theme, follow these steps:
* place the `edd-starter` theme folder in your `wp-content/themes/` directory
* create a new folder named anything, such as "your-edd-theme", and place it also in `wp-content/themes/`
* create a file in your new theme folder called `style.css` and place the following contents inside of it:

```css
/*
Theme Name:     Your Theme Name
Description:    Description of your theme
Author:         Your name
Author URI:		 http://yoursite.com
Template:       edd-starter
*/

@import url("../edd-starter/style.css"); 
```

Your theme will now be available in the `Appearance > Themes` page and you can modify the CSS to your liking.

For more information about child themes, visit the [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) page.

Configure EDD Constants and Extra Settings
-------------------------------------------------------

The `includes/edd-config.php` file demonstrates a variety of filters and constants you can use to modify EDD from the theme. This includes changing
the post type labels and slug, disabling the downloads archive, disabling the default styles, removing the default purchase buttons, and more.
